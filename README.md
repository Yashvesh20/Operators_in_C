# Experiment-2
# Aim : To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

# Software Required:

Visual Studio

# Theory:

C++ supports a wide variety of data types, and the programmer can select the data type appropriate to the needs of the application.

1. Character Data Type (char)
The character data type is used to store a single character. The keyword used to define a character is char. Its size is 1 byte, and it stores characters enclosed in single quotes (' ').

2. Integer Data Type (int)
Integer data type denotes that the given variable can store the integer numbers. The keyword used to define integers is int. 

4. Boolean Data Type (bool)
The boolean data type is used to store logical values: true(1) or false(0). The keyword used to define a boolean variable is bool.

4. Floating Point Data Type (float)
Floating-point data type is used to store numbers with decimal points. The keyword used to define floating-point numbers is float.

5. Double Data Type (double)
The double data type is used to store decimal numbers with higher precision. The keyword used to define double-precision floating-point numbers is double.

# Implementation: 
In this code i have asked the user for input for various datatypes and i have printed out the type and the size of the datatype.

# Conclusion:

In this practical i discovered about various types of datatypes available in c++.
